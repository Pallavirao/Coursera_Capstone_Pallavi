    "how would they go about finding the city with the wide variety of choices for pizza available in a short distance? \n",
    "The aim is to analyse Pizza storesâ€™ locations in major US cities and figure out which city has the widest variety of pizza chains on offer. Importantly, the different pizza places should not be spread out too far as that would make it difficult for our tourist to sample them if they are located very far from each other"

    "After this, to get an indication of density of pizza places, the centre coordinate of venues will be calculated to extract the mean longitude and latitude values. Post that, mean Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates will be calculated."
